  KalTest Package now part of iLCSoft
  
  ( F.Gaede, 2010/10/08)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The KalTest package has been included in the iLCSoft framework and can be 
installed with ilcinstall and built with cmake. The old Makefiles still work,
see description below (2005/08/26).


---- Building the KalTest library with cmake : 

  mkdir build
  cd build

  # initialize ROOT, e.g.
  . /afs/desy.de/project/ilcsoft/sw/i386_gcc34_sl4/root/5.27.06/bin/thisroot.sh

  # configure cmake
  cmake -DROOT_HOME=$ROOTSYS ..

  #build:
  make install


---- Building against the KalTest Library with cmake:

 a) in an iLCSoft package, simply add KalTest to your project dependencies in the CMakeLists.txt, e.g:


      SET( ${PROJECT_NAME}_DEPENDS "Marlin LCIO GEAR KalTest")

     

 b) use the usual cmake mechanism in your CMakeLists.txt :

      FIND_PACKAGE( KalTest ) 
    
      # -- and then use the following variables, as needed:
      #
      #  KalTest_INCLUDE_DIRS KalTest_LIBRARY_DIRS KalTest_LIBRARIES 
      #
      # e.g: 

      INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES( ${KalTest_INCLUDE_DIRS} )
    
      TARGET_LINK_LIBRARIES( ${LIBNAME} ${KalTest_LIBRARIES})


+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

  Note: with a cmake install the KalTest header files will be installed in 
        ./include/kaltest  so make sure you use this in your C++ files, eg:

      #include "kaltest/TKalTrackState.h"
      #include "kaltest/TKalTrackSite.h"
      #include "kaltest/TVKalState.h"


+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

2005/08/26    KalTest Package
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

0) Organization of the KalTest package
bin:             contains shell scripts to configure your system
conf:            contains an Imake template
doc:             documments
examples/kaltest: sample programs to illustrate usage of the libraries
src/geomlib:     geometry liabrary containing classes to describe track models and
                 measurement layers
   /kallib:      general purpose abstract base classes to implement Kalman filter 
                 algorithm (TVKalSystem, TVKalSite, TVKalState)
   /kaltracklib: derived classes that implement pure virtuals of kallib for track
                 fitting purpose and abstract base classes to describe
                 a) individual measurement layers (TVMeasLayer)
                 b) detector system as a collection of measurement layers carrying
                    information on the material budget (TVKalDetector)
                 c) hit point on each measurement layer (TVTrackHit)
   /utils:       a set of utility classes extracted from LEDA
Makefile:        makefile to build the libraries
README:          this file
setup:           script to setup environmental variables to run the sample programs

- See documments in the doc subdirectory for more information

1) How to Build the Kalman Filter Libraries
- Install ROOT if you haven't.
- Set ROOTSYS environmental variable accordingly.
- Source "setup" in the top directory of the KalTest source tree
  and make the libraries in it as follows:
  $ source ./setup
  $ make

2) How to Run Test Programs
- Cd to the examples/kaltest subdirectory.
- Choose one of the subsubdirectories in it:
    cdc: track fitting example for a jet-chamber-like central tracker
    ct:  track fitting example for a simple cylindrical tracker
    hybrid: hybrid track fitting example for VTX+IT(Barell/Fwd/Bwd)+TPC
    simple: a simple line fit example using the base kallib libraries only
- Cd into the subsubdirectory you chose, build the test program, and run
  as follows:

  For hybrid:
  $ make
  $ cd main/prod
  $ ./EXKalTest [-b] [# events] [pt in GeV] [t0 in ns]
  Notice that without -b, you will get into event display mode.

  For others:
  $ xmkmf -a
  $ make
  $ cd prod
  $ ./EXKalTest [# events] [pt in GeV]

Note:
  KalTest package has been built and tested on
	MacOSX 10.3
	RedHat 9.0
  with ROOT4.04.02b and the gcc3.x compiler.
