2005/02/23    KalTest Package
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

0) Organization of the KalTest package
bin:             contains shell scripts to configure your system
conf:            contains a Imake template
doc:             documments
examples/kaltest: sample programs to illustrate usage of the libraries
src/geomlib:     geometry liabrary containing classes to describe track models and
                 measurement layers
   /kallib:      general purpose abstract base classes to implement Kalman filter 
                 algorithm (TVKalSystem, TVKalSite, TVKalState)
   /kaltracklib: derived classes that implement pure virtuals of kallib for track
                 fitting purpose and abstract base classes to describe
                 a) individual measurement layers (TVMeasLayer)
                 b) detector system as a collection of measurement layers carrying
                    information on the material budget (TVKalDetector)
                 c) hit point on each measurement layer (TVTrackHit)
   /utils:       a set of utility classes extracted from LEDA
Makefile:        makefile to build the libraries
README:          this file
setup:           script to setup environmental variables to run the sample programs

- See documments in the doc subdirectory for more information

1) How to Build the Kalman Filter Libraries
- Install ROOT if you haven't.
- Set ROOTSYS environmental variable accordingly.
- Source "setup" in the top directory of the KalTest source tree
  and make the libraries in it as follows:
  $ source ./setup
  $ make

2) How to Run Test Programs
- Cd to the examples/kaltest subdirectory.
- Choose one of the subsubdirectories in it:
    cdc: track fitting example for a jet-chamber-like central tracker
    tpc: track fitting example for a TPC-like central tracker
    simple: a simple line fit example using the base kallib libraries only
- Cd into the subsubdirectory you chose, build the test program, and run
  as follows:
  $ xmkmf -a
  $ make
  $ cd prod
  $ ./EXKalTest

Note:
  KalTest package has been built and tested on
	MacOSX 10.3
	RedHat 9.0
  with ROOT4.00.08f and the gcc3.x compiler.
